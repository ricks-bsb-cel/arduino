# EEBoom
Probably the best way to add emulated EEPROM to your Arduino project:

- easy to use
- extremely low flash memory wear
- any number of independent EEPROM objects
- **ESP32**, **ESP8266** *(**STM32** is planned)*

### Basic example

```cpp
struct EE {
    int         devID = 0XEFBEADDA;     //it will be a default value
    short       step;                   //at the first init will be equal to zero
};

EEBoom<EE>      ee;

void setup() {
    ee.begin();                         //will use two default sectors
}

void loop() {
    ee.data.step++;                     //change data in RAM
    ee.commit();                        //fix it in flash memory
    delay(1000);
}
```

## How it works
We don't erase the entire memory page every time we need to update the data, we write a modified copy to the next available space on the same page.![](img/slot_chain.svg)

And only when we run out of space on the current page will we move on to the next page.

Thus:
- data is protected against ***any*** power failures
- physical wear and tear on memory tends to be as low as possible

The sectors are counted from larger to smaller:
```cpp
ee.begin(1000, 3);              //will fill 1000 -> 999 -> 998 -> 1000 -> ...
```

![](img/sect_chain.svg)



## Where will storage
- **ESP8266** - arduino framework provides one page of flash for EEPROM emulation. For `4MB` this is sector `1019` (total has `1024`). The sectors have a size of `4096 byte`. [Here](https://arduino-esp8266.readthedocs.io/en/3.1.2/filesystem.html) you can see more details.

    If we want to use more than one page, we have to sacrifice the ability to work with *SPIFFS/LittleFS* and *OTA Updates*, since they use the same pages (`1018`, `1017`, ...).

    On the other hand, the library has an option to return to the base sector. To do this, `ee.goZero()` must be called before attempting an update

    By default `ee.begin()` assumes the use of sectors `1019` and `1018` (for `4MB`). But you can always use any configuration - for example `ee.begin(1000, 100)` initializes pages `1000`-`901` for operation.

- **ESP32** - unlike ESP8266 memory is divided into partitions. Partitions have different types and purposes. For more details see [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-guides/partition-tables.html).

    ESP32 has a built-in solution for data storage - [NVS](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/storage/nvs_flash.html) (non-volatile storage). A special partition is allocated for storage, and sectors are formatted in a special way. We won't describe advantages and disadvantages here, we will only say that the versatility of *NVS* library makes it very wasteful.

    All information about partition structure is stored in `partition_table`, which is usually located at `0x8000`. You can download it with the command:
    ```
    esptool.py read_flash 0x8000 0xC00 partition.img
    ```
    There is special software that allows you to convert this image to a text file, but we can also look at it in a regular HEX editor
    ![](img/ard_partition_table_hex.png)
    On the right side you can see the text labels of the partitions. There are 32 bytes allocated for information about each partition. For example, we can see that the partition labeled `nvs` starts from address `0x900` (`00` `90` `00` `00` `00`) and has size `0x5000` (`00` `50` `00` `00` `00`), which corresponds to `5` sectors.

    There are a total of 6 partitions. `spiffs` - for working with file systems, `app0` - current firmware. `app1` - this is where firmware will arrive during *OTA Update*, `coredump` - for framework needs.

    `nvs` - should not be used for storage - various libraries and the kernel may use this area implicitly, which may lead to data loss

    `app1` - a good candidate if you don't plan to use updates

    `spiffs` - we use by default. `ee.begin()` without parameters initiates the last 2 sectors of this partition for storage.

    Worth mentioning is the ability to create *custom* partitions. For example [like this](https://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/platforms/espressif32.html#partition-tables). To initialize the last 10 sectors in a `mypartition` partition, you can call `ee.begin("mypartition", 10)`

ee.begin();
ee.data = 55;
ee.commit();                            //save to flash
//---------------------------
//for more convenience, you can wrap the data in a structure
//note how to set the values for the first zero init run
struct AppParam {

    char        ssid[20] = "Empty_SSID";
    char        pass[20] = "Empty_PASS";
};

EEBoom<AppParam>    ee;

ee.begin(1000, 5);                      //5 sectors 1000 -> 996

Serial.println(ee.data.devID);          //get data from our EEPROM

ee.data.devID = getID();                //change from some func
ee.data.maxSpeed = 70;                  //change limits
ee.data.arr[0] = 0x55;

strcpy(ee.data.ssid, "Awesom_SSID");    //new credentials
strcpy(ee.data.ssid, "Strong_PASS");

ee.commit();                            //don't forget to save it to flash
